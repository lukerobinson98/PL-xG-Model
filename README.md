# PL-xG-Model

## Description
The motivation for this project was to model the underlying statistics of Premier League teams to help my performance in Fantasy Premier League. The expected goals model enables me to observe which teams are under/overperforming, giving me a chance to bring players in from 'underperforming' teams. For example, this season Chelsea are underperforming in the Premier League table but are performing well in their underlying statistics, so their performances should improve.

## Table of Contents

2. Python file for the model to calculate team ratings
